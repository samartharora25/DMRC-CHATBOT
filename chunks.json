The appraisal aims at documenting (i) the nature of work done, (ii) quality of work done, (iii) outstanding contribution made, (iv) conditions under which various tasks have been performed, (v) suggestions for improvements (appraisee’s as well as appraiser’s), and (vi) developmental needs. 3. The appraisal aims at an assessment of the extent to which certain qualities (managerial and behavioral) considered as desirable for effective functioning as an Manager at IIMA, are exhibited by the candidate.  Such an assessment, along with a performance review discussion by each appraiser with the appraisee officer is expected to help the appraisee officer to strengthen his competencies as an officer. 4. The annual performance appraisal of officers requires a high degree of involvement of the officers in the form of listing his/her tasks, accomplishments, difficulties, developmental needs, etc. and discussing with the appraiser support requirements, etc. during the review period. 5. Based on the assessments made in the appraisal form, rewards (as and when applicable/ possible) and development decisions (training, field visits, job-rotation, etc.) may be taken from time to time. Besides this, the appraisal process itself is intended to provide an opportunity for improving one’s own effectiveness on the job through better planning, communication, and insights about job-performance. 77 IIMA HR Policy Manual 2023 78 IIMA HR Policy Manual 2023 79 IIMA HR Policy Manual 2023 80 IIMA HR Policy Manual 2023 81 IIMA HR Policy Manual 2023 82 IIMA HR Policy Manual 2023 83 IIMA HR Policy Manual 2023 84 IIMA HR Policy Manual 2023"

The policy covers the following Levels: Sr. No. Levels under 7 th CPC Old GP under 6 th CPC Group 1 Level 1 1300/1650/1800 D 2 Level 2 1900 D/C 3 Level 3 2000 D 4 Level 4 2400 D/C 5 Level 5 2800 D/C 6 Level 6 4200 B 7 Level 7 4600 B 8 Level 8 4800 B 9 Level 9 5400 (non Manager) B 2. The policy is based on the principle of Seniority-cum-performance. 3. At the lowest level, the promotion is entirely based on seniority and merit, with seniority getting reasonable weightage. At higher levels, merit and background gain weightage. CHAPTER 8 PROMOTION POLICY 86 IIMA HR Policy Manual 2023 4. The policy is applicable up to the Level 9 for employees (other than permanent research staff, academic associates and research staff). 5. The cut-off date for consideration is June 30 th of every year, the date on which the appraisal is done. So the period for consideration is July 1 to June 30. 6. The Promotion Exercise for staff will be conducted once in a year after receiving all Performance Appraisal forms, normally between September - October. 7. In the case of professional and technical positions or other post present or to be created in the future, which requires specific professional qualification and/or technical skills the same will be filled up with employees who possess such professional qualification or skill or technical competence. For recruitment and promotions to such posts preference weightages, as and when permissible, for an internal candidate shall be evolved, and the SEDC will finalize the criteria. 3.\t SOME IMPORTANT COMMON PROMOTION PARAMETERS FOR STAFF PROMOTIONS: 1. Length of Service/ Seniority: Seniority means the number of years spent by staff in a particular substantive level/scale/position from the last promotion or DOJ (in case of fresher). Two points are given for every year’s service. Every time a promotion is granted, the seniority gained so far is nullified, and it starts afresh in the new level/ position . In a case where the internal examination is to be conducted for the promotion exercise and one of the eligibility criteria to appear for such exercise is service in any level (e.g. for promotion to Level 10 from Level 7 or Level 8 or Level 9 with minimum 5 years’ of service in the Institute) then in such cases one point for every year’s service will be considered from the date of joining the minimum Level of eligibility and not from last promotion date. 2. Annual Appraisal/ Merit: Merit is one of the important components in the proposed scheme of promotion. A staff member undergoes an annual performance appraisal. This annual performance appraisal has a rating submitted by the supervisor. Merit score is derived from the ratings received by individual staff members after each year’s performance appraisal. The maximum points under merit will be 50 points. Following is the conversion of the ratings of each year into points: Merit Score for the year= Performance Appraisal Score/10 SEDC may normalize the score at the time of review, in case members feel that there is too much variation in the score awarded by various supervisors. In case, the employees’ promotion is delayed due to non-performance or any other reason, the performance appraisal score of last five years should be considered. 3. Educational Qualification: Institute has specified required qualifications for all jobs. Apart from the qualification acquired at the time of joining, a staff member may acquire an additional qualification during the period of consideration. For such additional qualification, a maximum of ten points are earmarked for the purpose of promotion. Depending on a candidate’s achievement in terms of qualifications, the SEDC will grant him/her points from 0 to 10, as per the following: 87 IIMA HR Policy Manual 2023 Sr. Qualification Points 1 Successful completion of any Master’s Degree. 10 2 Successful completion of any Graduation or any Post Graduate Diploma of minimum duration of one year. 08 3 Successful completion of any Diploma course or any ITI or professional course of minimum period of one year. 06 4 Successful completion of any Diploma / Certificate course or any ITI course of minimum period of six months. 04 5 Training (1 point each for completing 5 days of training) 02 4. Others: 1. Category wise Eligibility Score, termed as “Very Good” , for promotion is as follows: Sr. Category Promotion with Group change Promotion without Group Change, but Level change 1 General / OBC / PC 75 out of 100 70 out of 100 2 SC / ST 65 out of 100 60 out of 100 2. HR Department will maintain the scorecard for all employees coming under the purview of this policy. HR Department will put up to SEDC all those cases where an employee has completed required years of service on the date of review (1 st July) after DOJ or date of last promotion (DOLP). 3. Based on the availability of vacancies, the selected candidate(s) shall be considered for promotion by the Institute. 4. This exercise of promotion may be undertaken once in a year, most probably during September – October. The effect of the promotion would be given from the date as decided by the SEDC and based on vacancy available for promotion. 5. Any administrative delay in decision making may not have any bearing on the effective dates as decided by SEDC. 6. An employee who is unable to get promotion in a particular year after he has been considered by the Committee will have to wait until the next year when a similar exercise is undertaken. In such cases, there will be loss of seniority of one year. SEDC may decide to waive this off if the reason for holding back promotion was other than merit. 7. Those employees who intend to know their score will be informed of the score earned every year after the process of awarding the promotion has been completed. 8. Any employee whose rating on merit parameter in a particular year is appraised as poor, shall be informed about it and allowed to represent his/her case to the SEDC for review. 88 IIMA HR Policy Manual 2023 9. In case of awarding financial upgradation/ promotion to the employees near to their retirement, employees retiring within 12 months’ period from the date of completion of promotion cycle (i.e. 30 th June) can be considered for such purpose with relaxation in promotion criteria, provided they have performed very well and obtained appropriate score in last five years. 4.\t PROMOTION POLICY (FINANCIAL UPGRADATION) FOR EXISTING GROUP D EMPLOYEES: For existing Group D employees, the promotion is either through Personal Promotion (PP), Special Promotion (SP), Special Review One (SR-1) or Special Review Two (SR-2). As per the existing policy, the type of promotion depends on the number of years an individual has completed at the Institute from the date of joining. PP, SP, SR-1, and SR-2 is given to the employee, if the employee has completed 8, 16, 27 and 33/35 years respectively from the date of joining (DOJ) or as revised from time to time. Now, as all existing Group D employees who were in 6 th CPC GP 1300 and GP 1650 have been moved to Level 1 (GP 1800) irrespective of their service, the personal promotion which was available at GP 1650 on completion of 8 years of service in GP 1300 has been removed from the new policy. In the given circumstances, SEDC has introduced GP 2000 in Group C, special promotion-2 at GP 2000 with 20 years of service from the date of joining. So, now for existing Group D employees SP-1, SP-2, SR-1, and SR-2 are available to the employee if the employee has completed 10, 20, 27 and 33/35 years respectively from the date of joining (DOJ). SEDC will consider following promotion criteria for financial upgradation of Group D employees: Sr. Particulars Max. points 1 Length of Service/Seniority 20 2 Annual Appraisal 50 3 SEDC review / interactions 30 Total 100 Every year HR Department needs to submit the list of Group D employees, to review the cases for such promotions. SEDC may review the individual cases and decide on the promotion. Following conditions needs to be taken into consideration for Special Promotion of Group D employees: 1. The staff member under consideration should have obtained a “very good” cumulative score during the last five assessment years and should have a track record of excellent service in the Institute. Category wise eligibility score for promotion is as follows: Sr. Category Promotion without Group change 1 General / OBC / PC 70 out of 100 2 SC / ST 60 out of 100 2. He should not have indulged in any serious indiscipline at the Institute. 3. The staff member may be moved from one section to another, depending on the need of the Institute. Such staff members may also be required to undergo relevant training as per present or future requirements of the Institute. 89 IIMA HR Policy Manual 2023 4. Financial upgradation under the scheme shall be allowed in the immediate next higher level pay in the hierarchy of revised levels as per the policy of the Institute. 5. Financial upgradation would be on non-functional basis (i.e. Group D employee is categorised as Group D only) subject to eligibility and within the Group. 6. As such there shall be no additional financial upgradation for the senior employee on the ground that the junior employee in the level has got higher pay under the Scheme. If the senior employee remains on LWP or/and does not enhance the education qualification, then possible that a junior employee may get an advantage compared to a senior employee. 7. Following are the existing Level change in the Institute for Group D employees: Sr. Level Type of Promotion Minimum service in the Institute (from DOJ) 1 1 -- Entry 2 2 SP #1 10 years 3 3 SP #2 20 years 4 4 SR #1 27 years 5 5 SR #2 33/35 years (33 years to be considered, in case employee is retiring in the year immediate after review period/year). 5.\t PROMOTION POLICY FOR EXISTING GROUP D EMPLOYEES TO GROUP C (PROMOTION WITH GROUP CHANGE) AT ONE LEVEL HIGHER IN GROUP C"

      "text": "a)\t Leave Travel Concession is admissible to any employee of the Institute with one year of continuous service on the date of journey and his/her family for journey performed by self or by the family as the case may be. The concession is admissible once in a period of two calendar years for visiting home town or once in a period of four years for visiting a place anywhere in India to be specified before availing of the concession on each occasion. The block years for the purpose of this calculation shall be calendar years 2022-2025 and so on. b)\t The employees and their families, who are unable to avail themselves of the concession in a block of two or four years, maybe permitted to avail of the concession before the end of the first year  of the next block of two or four years. In the event of the return journey falling in the succeeding calendar year, the concession should be counted against the year in which the outward journey commenced. c)\t Home town means the permanent home town as given in the applications of the employees or such other place as declared by them supported by reasons such as ownership of immovable property, permanent residence of near relatives. The declaration of home town once made shall be treated final but in exceptional case the Institute may allow one change during the career of an employee on the individual merits of the case. d)\t “Family” for the purpose of leave travel concession means an employee’s wife or husband, as the case may be, two surviving unmarried children or stepchildren wholly dependent on the employee, irrespective of whether they are residing with the employee or not.

They should produce evidence of their having actually performed the journey as claimed by them. q)\t To enable the employees to avail of the concession, they may be granted an advance limited to 90% of the estimated amount which the Institute would have to reimburse in respect of the cost of journey both ways to the home town or any specified place and back. Where the employees and members of the family avail themselves of the concession separately, the advance also may be drawn separately. The advance shall have to be refunded if the outward journey is not commenced within 60 days of the grant of advance. r)\t The time-limit for drawal of LTC advance is 125 days ( i.e. 4 months and 5 days ) in case of journey by train. s)\t When advance is taken, the claim should  be settled within one month from the date of return journey. t) When no advance is taken, claim should be submitted within three months from the completion of return journey.

The members of the family of an employee may either travel together or separately in different groups as may be convenient to them.  Where they travel in different groups, at different times, reimbursement of expenditure may be allowed in respect of each group, provided the journey is performed during the currency of the block in respect of which the first group performed its journey.  The return journey of each group must be completed within six months from the date of commencement of the outward journey by that group. w)\t Entitlements for travel in LTC effective from July 01,2017 Pay Level in Pay Matrix Travel Entitlements 12 and above Economy class by air or AC I Class by train 9 to 11 Economy class by air or AC 2nd Class / Chair Car by train 6 to 8 AC 2 nd Class /Chair Car by train 5 and below AC 3 rd Class/Chair car by train RELOCATION CHARGES A newly joined staff member whether Permanent or TBSC joining the Institute from outside Ahmedabad will be reimbursed relocation expenses as per the below table or the actual cost whichever is less, as relocation charges on the production of vouchers, provided no other agency in India bears the cost.

Hostel subsidy is applicable only in respect of the child studying in a residential educational institution located at least 50 kilometers from the residence of the employee. 9. The upper age limit for Divyaang children has been set at 22 years. In the case of other children, the age limit will be 20 years or till the time of passing 12th class whichever is earlier.  There shall be no minimum age. 10.\t CEA is allowed in case of children studying through “Correspondence or Distance Learning” subject to other conditions laid down herein. 11.\t The CEA and Hostel Subsidy is admissible in respect of children studying from two classes before class one to 12th standard and also for the initial two years of a diploma/certificate course from Polytechnic/ITI/Engineering College, if the child pursues the course after passing 10th standard, and the employee has not been granted CEA/ Hostel Subsidy in respect of the child for studies in 11th and 12th standards. 12.\t The Children Education Allowance or hostel subsidy shall be applicable to the employee while he is on duty or is under suspension or is on leave (including extra ordinary leave). Provided that during any period which is treated as ‘dies non’ the employee will not be eligible for the CEA/Hostel subsidy for that period. 127 IIMA HR Policy Manual 2023 13.\t Reimbursement, as indicated above, will be applicable for expenditure on the education of school-going children only i.e., for children from nursery to twelfth class, including classes eleventh and twelfth held by junior colleges or schools affiliated to Universities or Boards of Education. 14.\t The reimbursement of Children Education Allowance shall have no connection with the performance of the child in his/her class. In other words, even if a child fails in a particular class, the reimbursement of Children Education Allowance shall be granted. 15.\t Under this scheme, reimbursement will be done once a year, after completion of the financial year. 16.\t In case the spouse of the Institute employee is a Government servant, only one of them can avail the reimbursement under the scheme subject to production of the certificate from the employer of the spouse that he is not claiming reimbursement under the scheme or in any other form. 17.\t Reimbursement can be made on the submission of the certificate issued by the Head of the Institution for the period/year for which claim has been preferred. The certificate should confirm that the child studied in the school during the previous academic year. In case such certificate cannot be obtained, self-attested copy of the report card or self-attested fee receipt (s) [including e-receipts] confirming/indicating that the fee deposited for the entire academic year can be produced as a supporting document to claim CEA. The provisions are effective from July 1, 2017 onwards."

This period of grace timemay be condoned unless it becomes a matter of frequent \nhabit. \n1.2\t The Head of the Department has to ensure that:\n1.2.1\t\nThe staff take a lunch break during specified hours (i.e. between 1:00 pm to 1:45 pm).\n1.2.2\t\n  The staff follow office time while coming to the office and leaving the office. \n1.2.3\t\nThe staff punch their presence via the biometric system in the terminal nearest to \ntheir department.\n1.3\t For the staff working on shift-basis, the timings will be decided by the HoD, according to the \nnature of work in the department. The shift timings, if different from the regular timings, \nshould be shared with the HR Office by every 1st day of the month.\n1.4\t Late attendance up to an hour for not more than two occasions in a month may be condoned \nby the Supervisor. Half-a-day Casual Leave will be debited for reporting late on the third \noccurrence. If the CL balance of the particular employee is nil, it will lead to deduction of EL. \n1.5\t If an employee does not improve on his punctuality; the Institute may initiate   disciplinary \nactions against the concerned employee in addition to the debiting of half-a-day’s Casual \nLeave to his account.  \n1.6\t It will be the responsibility of the HoD to inform the HR office regarding subordinates who \nremain absent from duty without informing or prior permission of the concerned authority. \nSuch unauthorised absence, if not condoned, can mean break-in-service. \n1.7\t The HoD should inform the HR Office, if an employee has obtained permission to attend late \nor to leave the office early. \n(2) PROCEDURE FOR GRANTING LEAVE\n2.1\t The grant of leave to the Institute employee is governed by the Institute Leave Rules.  These \nrules are framed in line with the leave rules applicable to the Central Government employees.\nCHAPTER 6\nLEAVE AND ATTENDANCE\n\n69\nIIMA HR Policy Manual 2023\n2.2\t Leave cannot be claimed as a matter of right. Based on the Institute’s requirement or public \nexigencies, leave can be denied. \n2.3\t The leave sanctioning authority may refuse or revoke leaves of any kind but cannot alter the \nkind of leave due and applied for. \n2.4\t The reasons for leave should invariably be indicated in the leave application.\n2.5\t Any planned leave for more than two days should be applied at least 10 days before the start \nof the leave.\n2.6\t On return from a leave of more than ten days, the employee should report for duty to the HoD \nand inform to the HR Office. \n2.7\t Leave should be applied through ESS in the same month in which it is availed. \n2.8\t Absence without leave not in the continuation of any authorised leave will constitute an \ninterruption of service unless it is regularized.\n(3) EXTENSION OF LEAVE \n3.1\t Requests for extension of leave should be avoided as far as possible.

      "text": "85\nIIMA HR Policy Manual 2023\n1.\t PREAMBLE \n\nThe Promotion Policy is a step in the direction of developing a comprehensive human resource \nframework for the Institute. The Promotion Policy is one of the components of that framework \nto specifically address the issue of promotion of employees. For the Promotion Policy to be \neffective, it is important to develop a scientific appraisal system, staff training and development \nprogramme and link them with the promotion. As promotion is a process of reward, incentive, \nencouragement, appreciation of very good performance and enabling personal growth of an \nemployee, it is important that the Institute takes up the responsibility of institutionalizing staff \ndevelopment and training so that the aspiration of the employee is balanced with the interest of \nthe Institute.\n2.\t THE POLICY IN BRIEF (FOR GROUP B/C/D)\n1.\t\nThe policy covers the following Levels: \nSr. \nNo.\nLevels under 7th CPC\nOld GP under 6th CPC\nGroup\n1\nLevel 1\n1300/1650/1800\nD\n2\nLevel 2\n1900\nD/C\n3\nLevel 3\n2000\nD\n4\nLevel 4\n2400\nD/C\n5\nLevel 5\n2800\nD/C\n6\nLevel 6\n4200\nB\n7\nLevel 7\n4600\nB\n8\nLevel 8\n4800\nB\n9\nLevel 9\n5400 (non Manager)\nB\n2.\t\nThe policy is based on the principle of Seniority-cum-performance.\n3.\t\nAt the lowest level, the promotion is entirely based on seniority and merit, with \nseniority getting reasonable weightage. At higher levels, merit and background gain \nweightage.\nCHAPTER 8\nPROMOTION POLICY\n\n86\nIIMA HR Policy Manual 2023\n4.\t\nThe policy is applicable up to the Level 9 for employees (other than permanent \nresearch staff, academic associates and research staff).\n5.\t\nThe cut-off date for consideration is June 30th of every year, the date on which the \nappraisal is done. So the period for consideration is July 1 to June 30.\n6.\t\nThe Promotion Exercise for staff will be conducted once in a year after receiving all \nPerformance Appraisal forms, normally between September - October.\n7.\t\nIn the case of professional and technical positions or other post present or to be created \nin the future, which requires specific professional qualification and/or technical skills \nthe same will be filled up with employees who possess such professional qualification \nor skill or technical competence. For recruitment and promotions to such posts \npreference weightages, as and when permissible, for an internal candidate shall be \nevolved, and the SEDC will finalize the criteria.\n3.\t SOME IMPORTANT COMMON PROMOTION PARAMETERS FOR STAFF \nPROMOTIONS: \n1.\t\nLength of Service/ Seniority: Seniority means the number of years spent by staff in \na particular substantive level/scale/position from the last promotion or DOJ (in case \nof fresher). Two points are given for every year’s service. Every time a promotion is \ngranted, the seniority gained so far is nullified, and it starts afresh in the new level/\nposition. \n\t\nIn a case where the internal examination is to be conducted for the promotion exercise \nand one of the eligibility criteria to appear for such exercise is service in any level (e.g. \nfor promotion to Level 10 from Level 7 or Level 8 or Level 9 with minimum 5 years’ \nof service in the Institute) then in such cases one point for every year’s service will be \nconsidered from the date of joining the minimum Level of eligibility and not from last \npromotion date. \n2.\t\nAnnual Appraisal/ Merit: Merit is one of the important components in the proposed \nscheme of promotion. A staff member undergoes an annual performance appraisal. \nThis annual performance appraisal has a rating submitted by the supervisor. Merit \nscore is derived from the ratings received by individual staff members after each \nyear’s performance appraisal. The maximum points under merit will be 50 points. \nFollowing is the conversion of the ratings of each year into points: \n\t\nMerit Score for the year= Performance Appraisal Score/10\n\t\nSEDC may normalize the score at the time of review, in case members feel that there is \ntoo much variation in the score awarded by various supervisors.  \n\t\nIn case, the employees’ promotion is delayed due to non-performance or any other \nreason, the performance appraisal score of last five years should be considered.\n3.\t\nEducational Qualification:  Institute has specified required qualifications for all \njobs. Apart from the qualification acquired at the time of joining, a staff member \nmay acquire an additional qualification during the period of consideration. For such \nadditional qualification, a maximum of ten points are earmarked for the purpose of \npromotion. Depending on a candidate’s achievement in terms of qualifications, the \nSEDC will grant him/her points from 0 to 10, as per the following:\n\n87\nIIMA HR Policy Manual 2023\nSr.\nQualification\nPoints\n1\nSuccessful completion of any Master’s Degree.\n10\n2\nSuccessful completion of any Graduation or any Post Graduate \nDiploma of minimum duration of one year.\n08\n3\nSuccessful completion of any Diploma course or any ITI or \nprofessional course of minimum period of one year.\n06\n4\nSuccessful completion of any Diploma / Certificate course or any \nITI course of minimum period of six months.\n04\n5\nTraining (1 point each for completing 5 days of training)\n02\n4.\t\nOthers:\n1.\t\nCategory wise Eligibility Score, termed as “Very Good”, for promotion is as \nfollows:\nSr.\nCategory\nPromotion with\nGroup change\nPromotion without\nGroup Change, but Level \nchange\n1\nGeneral / OBC / \nPC\n75 out of 100\n70 out of 100\n2\nSC / ST \n65 out of 100\n60 out of 100\n2.\t\nHR Department will maintain the scorecard for all employees coming under the \npurview of this policy. HR Department will put up to SEDC all those cases where \nan employee has completed required years of service on the date of review (1st \nJuly) after DOJ or date of last promotion (DOLP). \n3.\t\nBased on the availability of vacancies, the selected candidate(s) shall be \nconsidered for promotion by the Institute.\n4.\t\nThis exercise of promotion may be undertaken once in a year, most probably \nduring September – October. The effect of the promotion would be given from \nthe date as decided by the SEDC and based on vacancy available for promotion. \n5.\t\nAny administrative delay in decision making may not have any bearing on the \neffective dates as decided by SEDC. \n6.\t\nAn employee who is unable to get promotion in a particular year after he has \nbeen considered by the Committee will have to wait until the next year when \na similar exercise is undertaken. In such cases, there will be loss of seniority \nof one year. SEDC may decide to waive this off if the reason for holding back \npromotion was other than merit. \n7.\t\nThose employees who intend to know their score will be informed of the \nscore earned every year after the process of awarding the promotion has been \ncompleted.\n8.\t\nAny employee whose rating on merit parameter in a particular year is appraised \nas poor, shall be informed about it and allowed to represent his/her case to the \nSEDC for review.\n\n88\nIIMA HR Policy Manual 2023\n9.\t\nIn case of awarding financial upgradation/ promotion to the employees near \nto their retirement, employees retiring within 12 months’ period from the date \nof completion of promotion cycle (i.e. 30th June) can be considered for such \npurpose with relaxation in promotion criteria, provided they have performed \nvery well and obtained appropriate score in last five years.\n4.\t PROMOTION POLICY (FINANCIAL UPGRADATION) FOR EXISTING GROUP D \nEMPLOYEES: \nFor existing Group D employees, the promotion is either through Personal Promotion (PP), Special \nPromotion (SP), Special Review One (SR-1) or Special Review Two (SR-2). As per the existing \npolicy, the type of promotion depends on the number of years an individual has completed at the \nInstitute from the date of joining. PP, SP, SR-1, and SR-2 is given to the employee, if the employee \nhas completed 8, 16, 27 and 33/35 years respectively from the date of joining (DOJ) or as revised \nfrom time to time. Now, as all existing Group D employees who were in 6th CPC GP 1300 and GP \n1650 have been moved to Level 1 (GP 1800) irrespective of their service, the personal promotion \nwhich was available at GP 1650 on completion of 8 years of service in GP 1300 has been removed \nfrom the new policy. In the given circumstances, SEDC has introduced GP 2000 in Group C, special \npromotion-2 at GP 2000 with 20 years of service from the date of joining. So, now for existing \nGroup D employees SP-1, SP-2, SR-1, and SR-2 are available to the employee if the employee has \ncompleted 10, 20, 27 and 33/35 years respectively from the date of joining (DOJ). \nSEDC will consider following promotion criteria for financial upgradation of Group D employees:\nSr.\nParticulars\nMax. points \n1\nLength of Service/Seniority\n20\n2\nAnnual Appraisal\n50\n3\nSEDC review / interactions\n30\n \nTotal\n100\nEvery year HR Department needs to submit the list of Group D employees, to review the cases for \nsuch promotions. SEDC may review the individual cases and decide on the promotion. Following \nconditions needs to be taken into consideration for Special Promotion of Group D employees:\n1.\t\nThe staff member under consideration should have obtained a “very good” cumulative score \nduring the last five assessment years and should have a track record of excellent service in the \nInstitute. Category wise eligibility score for promotion is as follows:\nSr.\nCategory\nPromotion without Group change\n1\nGeneral / OBC / PC\n70 out of 100\n2\nSC / ST \n60 out of 100\n2.\t\nHe should not have indulged in any serious indiscipline at the Institute.\n3.\t\nThe staff member may be moved from one section to another, depending on the need of \nthe Institute. Such staff members may also be required to undergo relevant training as per \npresent or future requirements of the Institute.\n\n89\nIIMA HR Policy Manual 2023\n4.\t\nFinancial upgradation under the scheme shall be allowed in the immediate next higher level \npay in the hierarchy of revised levels as per the policy of the Institute.\n5.\t\nFinancial upgradation would be on non-functional basis (i.e. Group D employee is categorised \nas Group D only) subject to eligibility and within the Group. \n6.\t\nAs such there shall be no additional financial upgradation for the senior employee on the \nground that the junior employee in the level has got higher pay under the Scheme. If the \nsenior employee remains on LWP or/and does not enhance the education qualification, then \npossible that a junior employee may get an advantage compared to a senior employee.\n7.\t\nFollowing are the existing Level change in the Institute for Group D employees:\nSr.\nLevel\nType of \nPromotion\nMinimum service in the Institute (from DOJ)\n1\n1\n--\nEntry\n2\n2\nSP #1\n10 years\n3\n3\nSP #2\n20 years\n4\n4\nSR #1\n27 years\n5\n5\nSR #2\n33/35 years (33 years to be considered, in case \nemployee is retiring in the year immediate after \nreview period/year).\n5.\t PROMOTION POLICY FOR EXISTING GROUP D EMPLOYEES TO GROUP C \n(PROMOTION WITH GROUP CHANGE) AT ONE LEVEL HIGHER IN GROUP C \nTO THE CURRENT LEVEL IN GROUP D:\n1.\t\nMethodology: Written Test and Interview.\n2.\t\nEligibility: Group D employee of IIMA,,\ni.\t\nwith minimum graduation from a recognised university at the time of review,\nii.\t\nminimum service of 5 years,\niii.\t\nwith “very good” remarks in the Performance Evaluation Reports during last \nfive years.\niv.\t\nfulfilling all other financial upgradation/ promotion criteria.\n3.\t\nSyllabus: The syllabus of the written test may be as follows:\nSr.\nTopic\nMarks\n1\nGeneral English (Written and Spoken – equivalent to SCOPE \nsyllabus defined by Government of Gujarat) – Lower English\n30\n3\nComputer awareness (MS-Office-Word, Excel, Power Point, Internet, \nE-Mail) equivalent to CCC of Govt.of Gujarat \n25\n4\nNumerical ability (similar to Bank’s clerk examination)\n15\n5\nReasoning ability (similar to Bank’s clerk examination)\n15\n6\nGeneral awareness (similar to Bank’s clerk examination)\n15\nTotal\n100\n\n90\nIIMA HR Policy Manual 2023\nNote:\t The syllabus may be changed from time to time, depending on the Institutional \nrequirement.\n4.\t\nAgency for Training:  HR Department may select as per the standard procedure in \nconsultation with SEDC.

The policy covers the following Levels: Sr. No. Levels under 7 th CPC Old GP under 6 th CPC Group 1 Level 1 1300/1650/1800 D 2 Level 2 1900 D/C 3 Level 3 2000 D 4 Level 4 2400 D/C 5 Level 5 2800 D/C 6 Level 6 4200 B 7 Level 7 4600 B 8 Level 8 4800 B 9 Level 9 5400 (non Manager) B 2. The policy is based on the principle of Seniority-cum-performance. 3. At the lowest level, the promotion is entirely based on seniority and merit, with seniority getting reasonable weightage. At higher levels, merit and background gain weightage. CHAPTER 8 PROMOTION POLICY 86 IIMA HR Policy Manual 2023 4. The policy is applicable up to the Level 9 for employees (other than permanent research staff, academic associates and research staff). 5. The cut-off date for consideration is June 30 th of every year, the date on which the appraisal is done. So the period for consideration is July 1 to June 30. 6. The Promotion Exercise for staff will be conducted once in a year after receiving all Performance Appraisal forms, normally between September - October. 7. In the case of professional and technical positions or other post present or to be created in the future, which requires specific professional qualification and/or technical skills the same will be filled up with employees who possess such professional qualification or skill or technical competence. For recruitment and promotions to such posts preference weightages, as and when permissible, for an internal candidate shall be evolved, and the SEDC will finalize the criteria. 3.\t SOME IMPORTANT COMMON PROMOTION PARAMETERS FOR STAFF PROMOTIONS: 1. Length of Service/ Seniority: Seniority means the number of years spent by staff in a particular substantive level/scale/position from the last promotion or DOJ (in case of fresher). Two points are given for every year’s service. Every time a promotion is granted, the seniority gained so far is nullified, and it starts afresh in the new level/ position . In a case where the internal examination is to be conducted for the promotion exercise and one of the eligibility criteria to appear for such exercise is service in any level (e.g. for promotion to Level 10 from Level 7 or Level 8 or Level 9 with minimum 5 years’ of service in the Institute) then in such cases one point for every year’s service will be considered from the date of joining the minimum Level of eligibility and not from last promotion date. 2. Annual Appraisal/ Merit: Merit is one of the important components in the proposed scheme of promotion. A staff member undergoes an annual performance appraisal. This annual performance appraisal has a rating submitted by the supervisor. Merit score is derived from the ratings received by individual staff members after each year’s performance appraisal. The maximum points under merit will be 50 points. Following is the conversion of the ratings of each year into points: Merit Score for the year= Performance Appraisal Score/10 SEDC may normalize the score at the time of review, in case members feel that there is too much variation in the score awarded by various supervisors. In case, the employees’ promotion is delayed due to non-performance or any other reason, the performance appraisal score of last five years should be considered. 3. Educational Qualification: Institute has specified required qualifications for all jobs. Apart from the qualification acquired at the time of joining, a staff member may acquire an additional qualification during the period of consideration. For such additional qualification, a maximum of ten points are earmarked for the purpose of promotion. Depending on a candidate’s achievement in terms of qualifications, the SEDC will grant him/her points from 0 to 10, as per the following: 87 IIMA HR Policy Manual 2023 Sr. Qualification Points 1 Successful completion of any Master’s Degree. 10 2 Successful completion of any Graduation or any Post Graduate Diploma of minimum duration of one year. 08 3 Successful completion of any Diploma course or any ITI or professional course of minimum period of one year. 06 4 Successful completion of any Diploma / Certificate course or any ITI course of minimum period of six months. 04 5 Training (1 point each for completing 5 days of training) 02 4. Others: 1. Category wise Eligibility Score, termed as “Very Good” , for promotion is as follows: Sr. Category Promotion with Group change Promotion without Group Change, but Level change 1 General / OBC / PC 75 out of 100 70 out of 100 2 SC / ST 65 out of 100 60 out of 100 2. HR Department will maintain the scorecard for all employees coming under the purview of this policy. HR Department will put up to SEDC all those cases where an employee has completed required years of service on the date of review (1 st July) after DOJ or date of last promotion (DOLP). 3. Based on the availability of vacancies, the selected candidate(s) shall be considered for promotion by the Institute. 4. This exercise of promotion may be undertaken once in a year, most probably during September – October. The effect of the promotion would be given from the date as decided by the SEDC and based on vacancy available for promotion. 5. Any administrative delay in decision making may not have any bearing on the effective dates as decided by SEDC. 6. An employee who is unable to get promotion in a particular year after he has been considered by the Committee will have to wait until the next year when a similar exercise is undertaken. In such cases, there will be loss of seniority of one year. SEDC may decide to waive this off if the reason for holding back promotion was other than merit. 7. Those employees who intend to know their score will be informed of the score earned every year after the process of awarding the promotion has been completed. 8. Any employee whose rating on merit parameter in a particular year is appraised as poor, shall be informed about it and allowed to represent his/her case to the SEDC for review. 88 IIMA HR Policy Manual 2023 9. In case of awarding financial upgradation/ promotion to the employees near to their retirement, employees retiring within 12 months’ period from the date of completion of promotion cycle (i.e. 30 th June) can be considered for such purpose with relaxation in promotion criteria, provided they have performed very well and obtained appropriate score in last five years. 4.\t PROMOTION POLICY (FINANCIAL UPGRADATION) FOR EXISTING GROUP D EMPLOYEES: For existing Group D employees, the promotion is either through Personal Promotion (PP), Special Promotion (SP), Special Review One (SR-1) or Special Review Two (SR-2). As per the existing policy, the type of promotion depends on the number of years an individual has completed at the Institute from the date of joining. PP, SP, SR-1, and SR-2 is given to the employee, if the employee has completed 8, 16, 27 and 33/35 years respectively from the date of joining (DOJ) or as revised from time to time. Now, as all existing Group D employees who were in 6 th CPC GP 1300 and GP 1650 have been moved to Level 1 (GP 1800) irrespective of their service, the personal promotion which was available at GP 1650 on completion of 8 years of service in GP 1300 has been removed from the new policy. In the given circumstances, SEDC has introduced GP 2000 in Group C, special promotion-2 at GP 2000 with 20 years of service from the date of joining. So, now for existing Group D employees SP-1, SP-2, SR-1, and SR-2 are available to the employee if the employee has completed 10, 20, 27 and 33/35 years respectively from the date of joining (DOJ). SEDC will consider following promotion criteria for financial upgradation of Group D employees: Sr. Particulars Max. points 1 Length of Service/Seniority 20 2 Annual Appraisal 50 3 SEDC review / interactions 30 Total 100 Every year HR Department needs to submit the list of Group D employees, to review the cases for such promotions. SEDC may review the individual cases and decide on the promotion. Following conditions needs to be taken into consideration for Special Promotion of Group D employees: 1. The staff member under consideration should have obtained a “very good” cumulative score during the last five assessment years and should have a track record of excellent service in the Institute. Category wise eligibility score for promotion is as follows: Sr. Category Promotion without Group change 1 General / OBC / PC 70 out of 100 2 SC / ST 60 out of 100 2. He should not have indulged in any serious indiscipline at the Institute. 3. The staff member may be moved from one section to another, depending on the need of the Institute. Such staff members may also be required to undergo relevant training as per present or future requirements of the Institute. 89 IIMA HR Policy Manual 2023 4. Financial upgradation under the scheme shall be allowed in the immediate next higher level pay in the hierarchy of revised levels as per the policy of the Institute. 5. Financial upgradation would be on non-functional basis (i.e. Group D employee is categorised as Group D only) subject to eligibility and within the Group. 6. As such there shall be no additional financial upgradation for the senior employee on the ground that the junior employee in the level has got higher pay under the Scheme. If the senior employee remains on LWP or/and does not enhance the education qualification, then possible that a junior employee may get an advantage compared to a senior employee. 7. Following are the existing Level change in the Institute for Group D employees: Sr. Level Type of Promotion Minimum service in the Institute (from DOJ) 1 1 -- Entry 2 2 SP #1 10 years 3 3 SP #2 20 years 4 4 SR #1 27 years 5 5 SR #2 33/35 years (33 years to be considered, in case employee is retiring in the year immediate after review period/year). 5.\t PROMOTION POLICY FOR EXISTING GROUP D EMPLOYEES TO GROUP C (PROMOTION WITH GROUP CHANGE) AT ONE LEVEL HIGHER IN GROUP C"

          "text": "a)\t Leave Travel Concession is admissible to any employee of the Institute with one year of continuous service on the date of journey and his/her family for journey performed by self or by the family as the case may be. The concession is admissible once in a period of two calendar years for visiting home town or once in a period of four years for visiting a place anywhere in India to be specified before availing of the concession on each occasion. The block years for the purpose of this calculation shall be calendar years 2022-2025 and so on. b)\t The employees and their families, who are unable to avail themselves of the concession in a block of two or four years, maybe permitted to avail of the concession before the end of the first year  of the next block of two or four years. In the event of the return journey falling in the succeeding calendar year, the concession should be counted against the year in which the outward journey commenced. c)\t Home town means the permanent home town as given in the applications of the employees or such other place as declared by them supported by reasons such as ownership of immovable property, permanent residence of near relatives. The declaration of home town once made shall be treated final but in exceptional case the Institute may allow one change during the career of an employee on the individual merits of the case. d)\t “Family” for the purpose of leave travel concession means an employee’s wife or husband, as the case may be, two surviving unmarried children or stepchildren wholly dependent on the employee, irrespective of whether they are residing with the employee or not. In addition, it also includes parents and/or, stepparents (stepfather and stepmother), unmarried sisters, 121 IIMA HR Policy Manual 2023 unmarried minor brothers and married daughters who have been divorced, abandoned or separated from their husbands and widowed daughters who are residing with and wholly dependent on the employee. Widowed sisters are also included, if residing with and wholly dependent upon the employee (provided their father is either not alive or is himself dependent on the employee). e)\t The restriction of the concession to only two surviving children as indicated above shall not be applicable in respect of (i) those employees who already have more than two children prior to 20-10-1998 (ii) where the number of children exceeds two as a result of second child birth resulting in multiple births.- f) Children of sisters who are divorced, abandoned, separated from their husbands or widowed are not included in the term “Family”. g)\t A member of the family whose income from all sources, does not exceed the amount of minimum family pension prescribed (i.e. Rs. 9000 p.m.) and Dearness Relief thereon is deemed to be dependent on the employee h)\t Condition of dependency not applicable on the husband and wife.  Husband and wife is one unit for purpose of LTC and hence the condition of dependency is not applicable. i) Not more than one wife is included in the term “family” for the purpose of leave travel concession. j) In respect of places which are not connected by rail, the employees may travel by steamer/ air where an alternative means of travel is either not available or is more expensive. In such cases, the Institute bears the same proportion of cost as in the case of rail journeys. k)\t The liability of the Institute for the cost of railway fare between Ahmedabad and the home town or a specified place other than the home town is limited to the share of the fare by the shortest route calculated on a through ticket basis. l) The concession is restricted to journeys within India. m)\t The concession is admissible only in the case of journeys performed by the employee during regular leave or casual leave as the case may be, irrespective of their duration. In the case of the faculty, vacation is treated as leave for the purpose of this concession. The condition of leave shall not apply to the journeys performed by the members of the families of the employees. The concession is not admissible to an employee who proceeds on regular leave and then resigns the job without returning to duty. n) Entitlements of a fresh recruit : Fresh recruits are allowed to travel to their home town along with their families on three occasions in a block of four years and to any place in India on the fourth occasion.  The facility is available for the first two blocks of four years after joining the service for the first time. (i) The first two blocks of four years will apply with reference to the initial date of joining. The first two blocks of four years will be personal to them.  On completion of eight years, they will be treated at par with other regular employees. (ii) No carry over of LTC is allowed for a fresh recruit.  A fresh recruit whose hometown and headquarters are same cannot avail LTC. 122 IIMA HR Policy Manual 2023 o) Instructions on booking of tickets in respect of Leave Travel Concession (LTC): (i) In all cases of air travel in respect of LTC, air tickets can be booked by employees themselves or through the Travel Centre. (ii) Employees are encouraged to book flight tickets at least 21 days prior to the intended date of travel on LTC, to avail the most competitive fares and minimize burden on the Institute. (iii) Employees will have to choose a flight having the Best Available Fare on their entitled travel class which is the Cheapest Fare available, preferably for Non-stop flight in a given slot,   mentioned below, at the time of booking.

If an employee books a flight of their convenience through self-booking or through the Travel Centre other than the clauses mentioned above, the difference of airfare would be borne by the employee. p)\t The employee should inform the designated personnel in the accounts department before undertaking journey for which the concession under this scheme is claimed. They should produce evidence of their having actually performed the journey as claimed by them. q)\t To enable the employees to avail of the concession, they may be granted an advance limited to 90% of the estimated amount which the Institute would have to reimburse in respect of the cost of journey both ways to the home town or any specified place and back. Where the employees and members of the family avail themselves of the concession separately, the advance also may be drawn separately. The advance shall have to be refunded if the outward journey is not commenced within 60 days of the grant of advance. r)\t The time-limit for drawal of LTC advance is 125 days ( i.e. 4 months and 5 days ) in case of journey by train. s)\t When advance is taken, the claim should  be settled within one month from the date of return journey. t) When no advance is taken, claim should be submitted within three months from the completion of return journey.  Otherwise, the claim will be forfeited. u)\t In the case of the tickets for air travel booked by the Institute’s travel agent, there is no need to submit boarding passes for any travel undertaken for which the travel expenses are settled by the Institute. In all other cases, boarding pass need to be submitted for settling the account. 123 IIMA HR Policy Manual 2023 v)\t Employees and family as independent units :  The family members need not accompany the employees or even travel in the same calendar year in which the employee travels.    The members of the family of an employee may either travel together or separately in different groups as may be convenient to them.  Where they travel in different groups, at different times, reimbursement of expenditure may be allowed in respect of each group, provided the journey is performed during the currency of the block in respect of which the first group performed its journey.  The return journey of each group must be completed within six months from the date of commencement of the outward journey by that group. w)\t Entitlements for travel in LTC effective from July 01,2017 Pay Level in Pay Matrix Travel Entitlements 12 and above Economy class by air or AC I Class by train 9 to 11 Economy class by air or AC 2nd Class / Chair Car by train 6 to 8 AC 2 nd Class /Chair Car by train 5 and below AC 3 rd Class/Chair car by train RELOCATION CHARGES A newly joined staff member whether Permanent or TBSC joining the Institute from outside Ahmedabad will be reimbursed relocation expenses as per the below table or the actual cost whichever is less, as relocation charges on the production of vouchers, provided no other agency in India bears the cost.

The reimbursement of Children Education Allowance for Divyaang children of employees shall be payable at the double the normal rates of CEA prescribed above in clause (b) i.e. Rs. 4500/- per month (fixed). 6. The above rates/ceiling would be automatically raised by 25 % every time the Dearness Allowance on the revised pay structure goes by 50%. 7. Under this Scheme, one can avail the benefit up to a maximum of 2 children. 8. Hostel subsidy is applicable only in respect of the child studying in a residential educational institution located at least 50 kilometers from the residence of the employee. 9. The upper age limit for Divyaang children has been set at 22 years. In the case of other children, the age limit will be 20 years or till the time of passing 12th class whichever is earlier.  There shall be no minimum age. 10.\t CEA is allowed in case of children studying through “Correspondence or Distance Learning” subject to other conditions laid down herein. 11.\t The CEA and Hostel Subsidy is admissible in respect of children studying from two classes before class one to 12th standard and also for the initial two years of a diploma/certificate course from Polytechnic/ITI/Engineering College, if the child pursues the course after passing 10th standard, and the employee has not been granted CEA/ Hostel Subsidy in respect of the child for studies in 11th and 12th standards. 12.\t The Children Education Allowance or hostel subsidy shall be applicable to the employee while he is on duty or is under suspension or is on leave (including extra ordinary leave). Provided that during any period which is treated as ‘dies non’ the employee will not be eligible for the CEA/Hostel subsidy for that period. 127 IIMA HR Policy Manual 2023 13.\t Reimbursement, as indicated above, will be applicable for expenditure on the education of school-going children only i.e., for children from nursery to twelfth class, including classes eleventh and twelfth held by junior colleges or schools affiliated to Universities or Boards of Education. 14.\t The reimbursement of Children Education Allowance shall have no connection with the performance of the child in his/her class. In other words, even if a child fails in a particular class, the reimbursement of Children Education Allowance shall be granted. 15.\t Under this scheme, reimbursement will be done once a year, after completion of the financial year. 16.\t In case the spouse of the Institute employee is a Government servant, only one of them can avail the reimbursement under the scheme subject to production of the certificate from the employer of the spouse that he is not claiming reimbursement under the scheme or in any other form. 17.\t Reimbursement can be made on the submission of the certificate issued by the Head of the Institution for the period/year for which claim has been preferred. The certificate should confirm that the child studied in the school during the previous academic year. In case such certificate cannot be obtained, self-attested copy of the report card or self-attested fee receipt (s) [including e-receipts] confirming/indicating that the fee deposited for the entire academic year can be produced as a supporting document to claim CEA. The provisions are effective from July 1, 2017 onwards."
